Develop an algorithm to transform MIPS Assembly into Vectorized MIPS Assembly by utilizing C programming language to convert control dependences to data dependences, thus leveraging the advantages of Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processor
Implemented 9 optimization techniques on SPARC Assembly such as Branch Chaining, Eliminating Unconditional Jumps, etc. using Control Flow Graph (CFG) to decrease the number of static instructions in standard benchmarks by 25%)
