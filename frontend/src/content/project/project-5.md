Constructed a full-stack fitness tracking web application using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python Flask and Firebase that is fully containerized using Docker and hosted on a Digital Ocean instance with 4 other team members.
Led the back-end team to provide the web app with various security features such as SSL certificate to enable HTTPS protocol, client-side authentication token, Role-based access control (RBAC), and a Load Balancer for 2 concurrent servers.)
