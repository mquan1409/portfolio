Implemented and simulated various pandemic events for the SIR model and its variants (SIRD and SIR with background mortality) using Matplotlib and Python to predict the peak of a pandemic.)
Presented the research findings at the distinguished 41st SEARCDE 2023, a conference specializing in differential equations, with an attendance of 70 scholars.
